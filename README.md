## HELLO WORLD

My name is Yanis, I am a french CS student at [UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ©](https://u-paris.fr/).
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing, well I am a student after all. Nevertheless, would love to become an apprentice.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as possible. Either in classes, or in my spare time but the main themes I want to get better at are probably Rust and network engineering.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I will be glad to talk to new people !
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: yanis.lacenne@gmail.com
